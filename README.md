# dotfiles
My dotfiles for whatever I may be using at the time

## Installation

Simply run
``` sh
./install
```

All config files will be symlinked to their appropriate locations.

### Notes

* This doesn't check dependencies. It just installs the config files

* The installation script uses (bonclay)[https://github.com/talal/bonclay],
which will be downloaded when you run the script.

## motd

You can find the script in a more usable form at
